class Facilities:
    """Retrieve and manage facility location data for a given administrative area.
    
    This class provides functionality to retrieve existing facilities within a specified administrative area from 
    various data sources (currently supporting OpenStreetMap).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    admin_area_boundaries : Polygon or MultiPolygon
        The geographical boundaries of the administrative area for which to retrieve facilities
    data_src : str, default="osm"
        The data source from which to retrieve facility data. Currently supported:
        - "osm": OpenStreetMap
    osm_tags : dict, default=OSM_TAGS
        Dictionary of OpenStreetMap tags to identify facilities of interest (e.g., {'amenity': 'hospital'})
        
    Notes
    -----
    The default OSM_TAGS are defined in the constants module and typically target health facilities. To use 
    different facility types, provide custom osm_tags when creating the Facilities object.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pisa.administrative_area import AdministrativeArea
    >>> from pisa.facilities import Facilities
    >>> 
    >>> # Get an administrative area for a specific country and region
    >>> admin_area = AdministrativeArea("Timor-Leste", admin_level=1)
    >>> boundaries = admin_area.get_admin_area_boundaries("Baucau")
    >>> 
    >>> # Get hospital facilities within the administrative area
    >>> facilities = Facilities(admin_area_boundaries=boundaries)
