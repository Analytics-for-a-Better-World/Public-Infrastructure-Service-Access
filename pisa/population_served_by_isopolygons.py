"""Compute population coverage by facility service areas (isopolygons).

This module provides functions to determine which population points are covered by service areas
(isopolygons) around facilities at different distance thresholds. It helps answer questions such as
"How many people can reach a facility within X minutes?" or "Which populations are served by which
facilities at different distance thresholds?"

Examples
--------
Retrieve population coverage for example points and polygons::

>>> from shapely.geometry import Point, Polygon
>>> import geopandas as gpd
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> from pisa.population_served_by_isopolygons import get_population_served_by_isopolygons
>>>
>>> # Get administrative area and facilities
>>> admin_area = AdministrativeArea("Timor-Leste", admin_level=1)
>>> boundaries = admin_area.get_admin_area_boundaries("Baucau")
>>>
>>> # Get grouped population
>>> population = WorldpopPopulation(
>>>     admin_area_boundaries=boundaries,
>>>     iso3_country_code=country_code
>>> )
>>> grouped_population = population.get_population_gdf()
>>>
>>> facilities = Facilities(admin_area_boundaries=boundaries)
>>> existing_facilities = facilities.get_existing_facilities()
>>> 
>>> # Create a road network for travel time calculations
>>> road_network = OsmRoadNetwork(
>>>     admin_area_boundaries=boundaries,
>>>     mode_of_transport="walking",
>>>     distance_type="travel_time"
>>> )
>>> graph = road_network.get_osm_road_network()
>>> 
>>> # Calculate isochrones (5, 10, 15 minutes walking)
>>> isopolygon_calculator = OsmIsopolygonCalculator(
>>>     facilities_df=existing_facilities,
>>>     distance_type="travel_time",
>>>     distance_values=[5, 10, 15],
>>>     road_network=graph
>>> )
>>> isopolygons = isopolygon_calculator.calculate_isopolygons()
>>>
>>> # Find which population points are served by each isopolygon
>>> result = get_population_served_by_isopolygons(grouped_population, isopolygons)

    """Identify population points that fall within each facility's isopolygons.

    This function performs a spatial join between population points and isopolygons
    representing service areas at various distances from facilities. It returns a DataFrame
    showing, for each facility (cluster) and distance threshold, which population points
    are contained within the corresponding service area.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grouped_population : gpd.GeoDataFrame
        GeoDataFrame containing population points with geometry column.
        The index values are used as identifiers in the result.
        Must include a valid geometry column with point geometries.
    isopolygons : pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame where each column starting with 'ID_' contains Shapely Polygon objects
        representing service areas at different distances. Each row represents a facility
        isopolygon. The index values are used as Cluster_ID in the result.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame with columns:
        - Cluster_ID: The index from the isopolygons input
        - One column for each 'ID_' column in isopolygons, containing lists of
          population indices that fall within the corresponding polygon
    
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If either input DataFrame is empty

    Notes
    -----
    This function:
    1. Ensures both inputs have proper CRS (Coordinate Reference System)
    2. Performs a spatial join to find population points within each isopolygon
    3. Groups results by facility and distance threshold
    4. Returns population indices served by each facility at each distance threshold
