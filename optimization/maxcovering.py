Optimizing weighted maximal covering problems, J. Gromicho 2023.

We consider the optimization problem introduced in the paper below:

@Article{Church1974,
author="Church, Richard
and ReVelle, Charles",
title="The maximal covering location problem",
journal="Papers of the Regional Science Association",
year="1974",
month="Dec",
day="01",
volume="32",
number="1",
pages="101--118",
issn="1435-5957",
doi="10.1007/BF01942293",
url="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01942293"
}

This module includes mathematical optimization solvers and heuristics.

Although this is now a very well-known problem and there are several
open source implementations
(example https://github.com/cyang-kth/maximum-coverage-location)
we implemented here the research conducted during the following
master theses:

An Optimization Tool for Facility Location in Developing Countries
Case study for Timor-Leste by Joyce Antonissen, U. Tilburg, 2020

Solving Large Maximum Covering Location Problems with a GRASP Heuristic
Case-study for stroke facility allocation in Vietnam
by Fleur Theulen, U. Tilburg, 2022

The mathematical optimization models are related to the work of Joyce, but
while she used a double index formulation for the budgeted version of the
problem, we use a much more scalable single index formulation.

This is implemented directly in gurobipy to allow very fast model building and
optimization with the gurobi solver and also in pyomo to allow optimization
with any solver supported by pyomo, including many open source solvers.

The greedy and LocalSearch heuristics are faster and more scalable
re-implementations of those by Fleur.

Also includes an heuristic from Church and ReVelle that is not part of Fleur's
thesis.

Is still lacks a number of heuristics from Fleur:
 - 'adaptive' version of LocalSearch that tries to avoid hopeless attempts.
 - GRASP
 - path relinking

Besides functions documented with docstring, this model also exports the
following:
